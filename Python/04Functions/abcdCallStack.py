# The call stack is how Python remembers where to return the execution after each function call. The call stack isn’t stored in a variable in your program; rather, it’s a section of your computer’s memory that Python handles automatically behind the scenes. When your program calls a function, Python creates a frame object on the top of the call stack. Frame objects store the line number of the original function call so that Python can remember where to return. If the program makes another function call, Python adds another frame object above the other one on the call stack.

# When a function call returns, Python removes a frame object from the top of the stack and moves the execution to the line number stored in it. Note that frame objects always get added and removed from the top of the stack, and not from any other place.
